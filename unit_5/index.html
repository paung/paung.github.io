<p>Hello there, my name is Pansy and welcome to my portfolio site.

I am a creative geek who has worked in various agencies from big (Leo Burnett) to small (HMDG) producing campaigns across all platforms.

Creative ideas to me can be fun, they can be useful, they can be seemingly bonkers or they can be all of the above. Most of all they need to excite and get people talking.

My curious or some might say nosy nature for culture, innovations and just about everything gave me lots of valuable insights to create work that are relevant and engaging to people.

In my own time, I create campaigns and PR ideas for not-for-profit organisations, including 38 Degrees and The Brixton Windmill, a real old windmill that can be found on a housing estate in South London. I am also a mentor at the University of the Arts London.
