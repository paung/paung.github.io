<h3>BRIXTON WINDMILL</h3>
<p>As a personal project I have been involved with the Friends of Windmill for over four years, PR-ing an old windmill that can found on a housing estate in Brixton. In late 2012 we won a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to launch a project called Mill Memories.

Mill Memories is based on interviews with local residents about their memories of Brixton Windmill, showing its importance in local history and culture.

We produced an exhibition and a theatrical performance, which was put on at a Big Lunch in May 2014.

The book and interactive installations I produced were commended by the National Lottery Heritage Fund for the outstanding quality of work and are now used as teaching material for oral historians.

The interactive installations are now touring around London libraries and the book can be found in the British Library amongst others.</p>
